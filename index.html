    <h2>Featured Project: Patho Intelligence â€“ AI Breast Cancer Grading</h2>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This project helps pathologists identify breast cancer grades using Artificial Intelligence. Built into a mobile app with 82% grading accuracy using MobileNetV2, it aims to support diagnosis in real-time by guiding users to mark histopathological features such as tubules, nuclei, and mitotic cells.</p>

    <p><strong>AI Workflow:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tubule Task:</strong> Users spot over ducts in tissue patches to train AI on identifying normal formations.</li>
        <li><strong>Nuclear Task:</strong> Users annotate small, moderate, and abnormally shaped nuclei to reflect pleomorphism.</li>
        <li><strong>Mitotic Task:</strong> Spotting hyper-pigmented, irregular mitotic cells helps the AI classify cancer grades accurately.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example Criteria:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tubule Example:</strong> Point 1 â€“ clearly visible ducts; Point 2 â€“ abnormal ducts; Point 3 â€“ ducts disappear.</li>
        <li><strong>Nuclear Example:</strong> Point 1 â€“ uniform small nuclei; Point 2 â€“ moderate variation; Point 3 â€“ large abnormal nuclei.</li>
        <li><strong>Mitotic Example:</strong> Hyper-pigmented, distorted nuclei indicating active division.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Participation:</strong> Both expert and non-expert users can help improve accuracy by following in-app tutorials and properly annotating images. The app is currently available on Android only.</p>
